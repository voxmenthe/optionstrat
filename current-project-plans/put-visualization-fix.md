# PUT Option Visualization Fix: Resolved

## Problem Statement
The PUT option visualization was not displaying correctly, producing a flat line instead of the characteristic "hockey stick" shape. This issue occurred only with PUT options, while CALL options rendered correctly.

## Final Root Cause

The investigation revealed that the backend `option_pricer.price_option` method was failing when calculating Greeks (specifically Delta, Vega, and Rho) for American PUT options using certain QuantLib pricing engines (like `BinomialVanillaEngine` or `BaroneAdesiWhaleyApproximationEngine`) under the specific parameters used in the scenario analysis. This failure triggered an exception handler that returned a dictionary with `price: 0.0` and all Greeks as `0.0`. The scenario endpoint then aggregated these zero prices, leading to a flat `values` array being sent to the frontend, resulting in the flat line visualization.

## Solution Implemented

The fix involved making the backend option pricing more robust:

1.  **Switched Pricing Engine:** Changed the QuantLib pricing engine used for *all* American options (both PUTs and CALLs) within the `price_option` method to `ql.FdBlackScholesVanillaEngine`. This finite difference engine proved more stable for calculating both the price (NPV) and the Greeks under the scenario conditions.
    ```python
    # In OptionPricer.price_option
    if american:
        timeSteps = 100
        gridPoints = 100
        engine = ql.FdBlackScholesVanillaEngine(process, timeSteps, gridPoints)
    else:
        engine = ql.AnalyticEuropeanEngine(process)
    option.setPricingEngine(engine)
    ```

2.  **Resilient Greek Calculations:** Wrapped each individual Greek calculation (`option.delta()`, `option.gamma()`, etc.) within its own `try...except` block. If a specific Greek calculation fails, a warning is logged, that Greek defaults to `0.0`, but the function continues to calculate the price (NPV) and other Greeks. This prevents a single failing Greek from zeroing out the entire result, crucially allowing the price to be returned correctly.
    ```python
    # Example for Delta:
    try:
        print("Calculating Delta...")
        raw_delta = option.delta()
        delta = raw_delta / 100.0
        print(f"Calculated Delta: {raw_delta} -> {delta}")
    except Exception as delta_error:
         print(f"WARNING: Delta calculation failed: {delta_error}. Returning Delta as 0.")
         # delta remains 0.0 (default)
    # ... similar blocks for gamma, theta, vega, rho ...
    ```

3.  **Removed Incorrect Frontend/Backend Volatility Logic:** Previous attempts focused on frontend volatility handling and PUT-specific logic were removed or simplified as the root cause was identified in the backend pricing engine and Greek calculation resilience.

## Outcome
With these backend changes, the `option_pricer` now successfully returns non-zero, varying prices for PUT options across the scenario range, even if some secondary Greek calculations still encounter issues. This correct price data allows the frontend `PayoffDiagram` component to render the expected "hockey stick" shape for PUT options.

## Remaining Issues (Addressed in new plan)
- Backend logs still indicate default volatility (0.3) is often used.
- Greek calculations (Vega, Rho) still frequently fail and default to 0, although the price is now correct.
