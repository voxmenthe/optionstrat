# OptionsStrat - Overall Project Plan

## Project Overview

OptionsStrat is a comprehensive options analysis and visualization tool designed to help traders and investors analyze option strategies, calculate Greeks, and explore different market scenarios. The application combines a modern frontend with a powerful backend that leverages QuantLib for accurate options pricing and scenario analysis.
