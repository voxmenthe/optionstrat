GOAL: Implement Phase 1 of the Editable Positions Sheet

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Created a reusable EditableCell component that:
   - Handles different input types (text, number, select, date)
   - Provides validation functionality
   - Manages edit state and focus
   - Supports formatting for display
   - Uses requestAnimationFrame for UI responsiveness
   - Provides visual feedback during editing

2. Implemented EditablePositionTable component that:
   - Integrates with the existing position store
   - Makes non-calculated fields directly editable (quantity, strike, premium, expiration, type, action)
   - Implements field-specific validation rules
   - Triggers recalculation after edits
   - Maintains the same grouping and display functionality as the original table

3. Created a new route at /positions/editable for testing the editable positions functionality
   - Added navigation between standard and editable views
   - Added user instructions for the editable functionality
