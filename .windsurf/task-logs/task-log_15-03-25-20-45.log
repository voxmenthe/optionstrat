GOAL: Fix UI issues in the option chain selector toggle and prevent false unsaved changes popup
IMPLEMENTATION: 
1. Fixed the option chain toggle switch UI issues:
   - Modified the toggle switch CSS to properly display the "on" state when option chain mode is active
   - Used direct conditional styling based on the useOptionChain state instead of relying on peer selectors
   - Added proper focus ring styling for accessibility

2. Prevented the false "unsaved changes" popup when toggling the option chain selector:
   - Added a separate state variable (userModifiedForm) to track actual user modifications to the form
   - Modified the handleModeToggle function to only show the confirmation dialog if the user has actually made changes
   - Updated all relevant state management functions to properly track user vs. system-initiated changes

3. Enhanced the OptionChainSelector component:
   - Added proper TypeScript interfaces for props and improved type safety
   - Fixed the logger import path
   - Implemented the option selection functionality
   - Added support for compact mode and showing Greeks
   - Integrated the OptionChainTable component for displaying and selecting options

4. Fixed various TypeScript errors:
   - Added proper type assertions for option types
   - Fixed property access for lastPrice instead of using non-existent properties
   - Removed unnecessary id attribute from PositionForm component

These changes ensure a smoother user experience when toggling between manual entry and option chain selection modes, while also improving the type safety and reliability of the code.
