GOAL: Fix P&L Calculation Errors and Replace Position Table with Editable Version

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Enhanced Error Handling in API Layer:
   - Updated the PnLResult interface in positionStore.ts to include an endpointNotImplemented flag
   - Modified positionsApi.ts to reduce console errors for network issues with P&L endpoints
   - Improved apiClient.ts to suppress network error logging for P&L endpoints in development mode
   - Added environment-aware logging that uses console.debug instead of console.error/log

2. Improved UI Components:
   - Replaced the original PositionTable with EditablePositionTable in the main positions page
   - Removed the separate editable positions page since it's now the default view
   - Added informational guidance for users about the editable functionality

3. Technical Details:
   - Added proper error detection for network errors (status 0) and missing endpoints
   - Implemented conditional logging based on development/production environment
   - Enhanced timeout handling with cleaner error recovery
   - Added proper type safety with the endpointNotImplemented flag
