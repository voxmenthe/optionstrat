GOAL: Implement performance optimizations for the Option Chain Selector

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
1. Add pagination for large option chains
   - Design and implement pagination UI for the option chain table
   - Implement client-side pagination logic
   - Add server-side pagination API support if needed
   - Optimize loading performance for large chains

2. Implement client-side caching
   - Create cache layer for recently fetched option chains
   - Add cache invalidation strategy (time-based and market hours-based)
   - Optimize repeat queries for the same ticker/expiration
   - Add background refresh for real-time data

3. Optimize search functionality
   - Implement debounced search to reduce API calls
   - Add recent/favorite tickers functionality
   - Optimize typeahead suggestions
   - Improve error handling for search failures

PRIORITY: Medium
ESTIMATED COMPLETION TIME: 4 days

PROGRESS UPDATE (March 9, 2025):

1. Pagination Implementation (COMPLETED)
   - Created a reusable Pagination component in `/src/frontend/components/Pagination.tsx`
   - Integrated pagination into OptionChainTable with configurable page size
   - Updated OptionChainSelector to pass pagination props to OptionChainTable
   - Added state management for current page and page size

2. Client-side Caching Implementation (COMPLETED)
   - Created a CacheManager utility in `/src/frontend/lib/utils/cacheUtils.ts`
   - Implemented TTL-based caching with market hours awareness
   - Added cache invalidation strategies
   - Integrated caching into optionChainStore for:
     - Expiration dates
     - Option chain data
     - Underlying price data
   - Added cache clearing functionality

3. Performance Optimizations (COMPLETED)
   - Fixed TypeScript issues related to Map iteration
   - Optimized cache key generation for different filter combinations
   - Added configurable TTLs based on market hours

NEXT STEPS:
1. Implement debounced search for ticker input
2. Add recent/favorite tickers functionality
