GOAL: Fix option chain loading errors and update project plans
IMPLEMENTATION: 
1. Identified and fixed a schema mismatch in the backend API:
   - The OptionExpiration schema required a 'formatted_date' field, but the API was returning 'date' and 'days_to_expiration'
   - Modified the get_expirations function in options.py to correctly populate the 'formatted_date' field
   - Kept the 'date' field as a proper datetime object for better type safety
   - Verified the fix by testing the API endpoint directly

2. Analyzed the current implementation status:
   - Confirmed that the option chain loading now works correctly
   - Identified that the next step is to implement the selection of options from the chain to populate the positions table
   - Reviewed the existing OptionChainSelector, OptionChainTable, and PositionFormWithOptionChain components

3. Verified the integration between option chain selection and position creation:
   - The OptionChainTable component has an onSelect callback that passes the selected option to the parent
   - The PositionFormWithOptionChain component handles the option selection and maps it to form data
   - The form data is then used to populate the position form with the selected option details
   - The UI provides feedback to the user about the selected option
