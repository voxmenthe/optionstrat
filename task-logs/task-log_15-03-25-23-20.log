GOAL: Fix Option Selection Errors in Option Chain

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Fixed TypeScript errors in the isInTheMoney function:
   - Removed references to non-existent properties (inTheMoney)
   - Simplified the function to calculate ITM status based on option type and underlying price

2. Fixed option data validation in optionChainStore.ts:
   - Made validation less strict to prevent filtering out valid options
   - Added enhanced logging to better understand the data flow
   - Improved error handling for empty or invalid results

3. Added property name mapping in optionsApi.ts:
   - Created mapOptionResponseToCamelCase function to convert snake_case API responses to camelCase
   - Fixed the issue where backend returns option_type but frontend expects optionType
   - Added detailed logging to verify the mapping is working correctly

4. Enhanced error handling and debugging:
   - Added more detailed logging throughout the option chain loading process
   - Improved error messages to provide better feedback to users
