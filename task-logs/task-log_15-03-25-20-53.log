GOAL: Fix Option Chain Display Issues and Plan Future Enhancements

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Backend Improvements:
   - Enhanced the `get_expirations` endpoint in `options.py` to properly calculate days to expiration
   - Added detailed logging for expiration dates and days to expiration for better debugging
   - Removed duplicate imports and cleaned up unused imports in the backend code
   - Verified that the `OptionExpiration` model includes the `days_to_expiration` field

2. Frontend Improvements:
   - Previously updated the `getExpirations` method in `optionsApi.ts` to correctly map backend's `days_to_expiration` field to frontend's `daysToExpiration` field
   - Confirmed that the `OptionChainSelector` component can display the expiration dates with days to expiration

3. Testing and Verification:
   - Successfully ran both backend and frontend servers
   - Verified the application loads correctly in the browser
   - Confirmed that days to expiration are being calculated and logged in the backend

NEXT STEPS:
1. Fix Popup Issue:
   - Investigate and fix the UI freezing issue when the option chain popup appears
   - Implement proper loading states and animations for better user experience
   - Ensure the popup is responsive and doesn't block the UI thread

2. Enhance Position Table:
   - Implement functionality to populate the position table with an option once selected from the option chain
   - Create a data flow from option selection to position table update
   - Add validation to ensure only valid options can be added to positions

3. Make Positions Editable:
   - Convert position table to a spreadsheet-like interface
   - Implement inline editing for position parameters (quantity, strike price, etc.)
   - Add real-time validation and feedback for position edits
   - Ensure changes are properly saved and reflected in calculations

4. Performance Optimizations:
   - Improve option chain loading performance
   - Implement pagination or virtualization for large option chains
   - Add caching for frequently accessed option data

5. UI/UX Improvements:
   - Enhance visual feedback during loading states
   - Improve error handling and user notifications
   - Ensure consistent styling across the application

TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for UI updates to prevent freezing
- Implement proper state management during loading operations
- Add comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Consider implementing debouncing for search operations
- Ensure proper cleanup of timeouts and aborted requests
