Below are three different option structures you might consider when you have a bearish bias on a high-beta stock, with implied volatility (IV) that is elevated but not extreme. Each aims to capture meaningful negative delta and gamma exposure while also mitigating some of the time decay (theta). All are net‐debit strategies overall.

---

## 1) Bear Put Spread (Debit Put Spread)

### Rationale
- **Directional bias**: Bearish
- **Delta**: Negative
- **Gamma**: Positive (mainly from the long put)
- **Theta mitigation**: The short put helps offset some of your time decay.

### Construction Example
1. **Buy** 1 at-the-money (ATM) or slightly in-the-money (ITM) put.
2. **Sell** 1 out-of-the-money (OTM) put with a lower strike.

This reduces the total cost compared to simply buying a long put, which helps manage the impact of time decay.

### Risk/Reward
- **Max profit**: Limited to the difference between the two strikes minus the debit paid.
- **Max loss**: The net debit paid.
- **Breakeven**: The upper long put strike minus the net debit paid.
  
### Why This Fits
- Still gets you **negative delta** to profit from a move down.
- The short put partially offsets the cost and time decay.
- **Gamma** is less than a naked long put but still meaningful near the money.

## 2) Diagonal Put Spread (Bearish Diagonal)

### Rationale
- **Directional bias**: Bearish
- **Delta**: Negative (longer-dated put is long delta exposure, but overall negative on the underlying)
- **Gamma**: The near-dated short option and the longer-dated long option combine to create a complex but net positive gamma near-term—especially if you structure the long put near-the-money.
- **Theta mitigation**: The short near-dated put offsets part of your premium outlay and decays faster.

### Construction Example
1. **Buy** 1 longer-dated (e.g., 2-3 months out) slightly in-the-money or at-the-money put.  
2. **Sell** 1 near-dated (e.g., 2-4 weeks to expiration) out-of-the-money put.

The strike you sell can be chosen so that if the stock declines quickly, you benefit from the long put’s delta/gamma, while collecting premium from the short put. As the short put expires, you can potentially roll it forward to collect more credit—helping to finance the longer-dated long put.

### Risk/Reward
- **Max profit**: Potentially significant if the stock drops quickly—your long put can increase in value, while the short put is offset by premium and can expire worthless.
- **Max loss**: The net debit, plus any assignment risk on the short put if the underlying moves below that strike at expiration.
- **Greeks**: You get **positive vega** on the longer-dated put, which helps if implied volatility rises on a downturn.

### Why This Fits
- The **shorter-dated option** helps with **theta** costs.
- The longer-dated put gives you **negative delta** and can benefit from volatility expansion.
- You typically maintain **net debit**, with reduced time decay (due to the short leg).

## 3) Broken-Wing Put Butterfly (Bearish Biased)

### Rationale
- **Directional bias**: Moderately bearish
- **Delta**: Negative (especially if centered below the current underlying price).
- **Gamma**: Positive around the middle strike(s).
- **Theta mitigation**: The short middle puts help reduce the net debit and thus reduce time decay compared to just buying a put or a wide spread.

### Construction Example
1. **Buy** 1 put at a strike slightly above (or near) the money.
2. **Sell** 2 puts at a lower strike (the “body” of the butterfly).
3. **Buy** 1 put further out-of-the-money (wings are “broken” if you buy a cheaper, further OTM strike, creating a slight asymmetry).

This structure can be established for a net debit but typically smaller than just a straight put or vertical. The “broken wing” aspect might shift the risk profile so that you have less risk on one side (the upside) and more on the other. 

### Risk/Reward
- **Max profit**: Occurs if the underlying lands near the short strike at expiration.  
- **Max loss**: On the upside, typically limited to the net debit. If truly “broken wing,” the downside max loss could be higher if the stock crashes below the lower wing.
- **Breakeven**: Near your upper long put strike minus the debit paid (upper side), and near your lower strike(s) minus the net debit on the downside (exact numbers depend on strikes).

### Why This Fits
- It gives you a **net debit** trade with a **bearish tilt**.
- You get a decent **negative delta** if initiated around or slightly below the underlying’s current price.
- The middle short strikes help offset the cost (lower theta).
- It offers a “sweet spot” if the stock moves down but not drastically below your lower long put.

## Choosing Among Them

1. **Bear Put Spread**:
   - Simpler structure, fixed risk and reward.
   - Good if you want a straightforward **directional** play with limited capital outlay.

2. **Diagonal Put Spread**:
   - More moving parts (and rolling opportunities).
   - Potentially **profitable if volatility rises** or if time passes and the short put expires worthless.
   - Better if you want to keep a longer‐dated option while selling front‐dated options to help finance it.

3. **Broken-Wing Put Butterfly**:
   - Offers a **lower debit** and a specific “sweet spot” profit zone.
   - Good if you expect a moderate move down into a price zone near the body of the butterfly.
   - If the underlying makes a big move below the body, it can still be profitable, but the “broken wing” aspect determines how much risk you have on the far downside.

All three structures meet the criteria of having a **bearish exposure**, a **net debit** (with possible partial theta offsets), and a **meaningful negative delta** and positive gamma profile near-the-money. The choice ultimately depends on your specific outlook (degree of bearishness), comfort with complexity/rolls, and desired profit zone.


Here are three options strategies tailored for a bearish outlook on a high-beta stock with elevated (but not extreme) implied volatility. Each balances delta/gamma exposure, theta mitigation, and debit structure:

1. Long Put Diagonal Spread

Structure:

Buy a longer-dated ATM put (e.g., 60–90 DTE).
Sell a shorter-dated OTM put (e.g., 30 DTE) at a lower strike.

Rationale:

Delta/Gamma: The long ATM put provides significant negative delta and positive gamma. The short OTM put slightly reduces delta (its positive delta offsets the long put’s negative delta) but retains net bearish exposure.
Theta Mitigation: The short put decays faster (theta-positive), offsetting theta decay from the long put.
Debit Cost: Lower net debit than a naked long put, as the short put reduces premium paid.
Volatility: Benefits if longer-term IV rises or stays elevated.

Risk: Limited to net debit. Profit increases if the stock declines before the short put expires.

2. Put Backspread (1:2 Ratio)

Structure:

Sell 1 ATM put (30–45 DTE).
Buy 2 OTM puts (same expiry, lower strike).

Rationale:

Delta/Gamma: Initially small negative delta (short ATM put’s +delta) that becomes strongly negative if the stock drops, as OTM puts gain delta rapidly (high gamma).
Theta Mitigation: The short ATM put generates theta decay, offsetting theta from the long OTM puts.
Debit/Credit: Often structured for a slight credit or small debit.
Volatility: Profits from a sharp drop (high gamma) or IV expansion.

Risk: Losses capped if the stock rallies (max loss = credit received - net debit + difference in strikes).

3. Bear Collar with a Twist

Structure:

Buy an ATM put (60 DTE).
Sell an OTM call (same expiry).
Sell a nearer-term OTM put (e.g., 30 DTE).

Rationale:

Delta/Gamma: The long put provides negative delta and gamma; the short call adds mild positive delta (OTM) but reduces cost. The short put further mitigates theta.
Theta Mitigation: Theta-positive from the short call and short put offsets the long put’s theta decay.
Debit Cost: Low debit or potential credit.
Volatility: Retains upside protection (long put) while monetizing elevated IV via short options.

Risk: Limited profit potential (capped by short call). Max loss occurs if the stock surges above the short call or collapses below the short put.

Key Considerations
High Beta: These strategies capitalize on the stock’s volatility to amplify bearish gains.
IV Positioning: Selling shorter-dated options monetizes high IV while retaining longer-dated long puts for directional exposure.
Gamma Focus: All strategies prioritize gamma to accelerate profits as the stock declines.
Theta Tradeoff: Theta is mitigated but not eliminated; avoid excessively long-dated long options to limit decay.

Choose based on risk tolerance, capital allocation, and expected timing of the bearish move. The Long Put Diagonal is ideal for gradual declines, while the Put Backspread excels in crashes. The Bear Collar balances cost and protection.
