# Integration Tests Status Report

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation status of integration tests for the OptionsStrat application. Integration tests verify that different components of the system work together correctly in real-world scenarios.

## Current Status

We have created the initial integration test suite structure and implemented several key integration tests. However, more tests are needed to cover all critical end-to-end functionality.

### Completed

- [x] Set up integration tests directory structure
- [x] Created common fixtures in conftest.py
- [x] Implemented test_strategy_pipeline.py
  - Tests the complete position creation to visualization pipeline
  - Tests the calculation of Greeks for positions
  - Tests scenario analysis generation
- [x] Implemented test_market_data_pipeline.py
  - Tests market data retrieval and caching
  - Tests option chain retrieval and processing
  - Tests multi-expiration scenario analysis
- [x] Implemented test_database_persistence.py
  - Tests database operations with relationships
  - Tests API-to-database persistence
  - Tests cascading updates and deletes

### In Progress

- [ ] Authentication and authorization tests
- [ ] Performance tests with large datasets
- [ ] Error handling and recovery tests

### Not Started

- [ ] Front-to-back integration tests with mock frontend
- [ ] System behavior during API outages
- [ ] Load testing and concurrency testing

## Issues and Challenges

1. **API Endpoint Structure**: Initial tests failed because the API endpoint structure in the tests did not match the actual implementation. This has been fixed by updating the tests to use the correct endpoint paths.

2. **Database Module Import**: Tests were trying to import from 'app.database' but the database module is actually located at 'app.models.database'. This has been fixed.

3. **Redis Dependency**: Some tests require Redis for caching. We've added conditional logic to skip Redis-dependent tests when Redis is not available.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Remaining Tests**: Implement the remaining priority integration tests:
   - Authentication and rate limiting tests
   - Error handling and recovery tests
   - Front-to-back integration tests

2. **Add Performance Tests**: Implement tests to measure and verify system performance:
   - Benchmark API response times
   - Test system behavior under load
   - Identify performance bottlenecks

3. **Set Up CI Pipeline**: Configure the CI pipeline to run integration tests:
   - Set up required dependencies in CI environment
   - Configure test database for CI
   - Add integration test step to CI workflow
