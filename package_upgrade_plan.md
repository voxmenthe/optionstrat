## Fallback Plan

If the upgrades cause significant issues:

1. **Individual Package Rollbacks**: If a specific package upgrade causes problems, roll back just that package:
   ```
   npm install package-name@previous-version
   ```

2. **Complete Rollback**: If multiple issues occur, restore from git:
   ```
   git checkout package.json
   git checkout package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

3. **Staged Approach**: If a full upgrade is too disruptive, consider upgrading one major package at a time and stabilizing before moving to the next.

## Timeline

- Research & Preparation: 1 day
- Next.js Upgrade: 1-2 days
- Tailwind CSS Upgrade: 1 day
- Other Dependencies: 1 day
- Testing & Validation: 1-2 days
- Cleanup & Documentation: Half day

**Total Estimated Time**: 5-7 days
